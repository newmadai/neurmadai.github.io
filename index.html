<p style="font-size: 150%">The 1st Workshop on Neural Reasoning and Mathematical Discovery
   (NEURMAD@AAAI'25 [nju: m√¶d 'ei'ai]) will take place on March 3 or 4, 2025, as part of 
   the The 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Philadelphia, USA.<p>

<h2>The description</h2>
<p>
The commingling of neural networks and mathematics creates a two-way street: (1) using mathematics to develop novel neural networks that may reach the rigour of logical reasoning, and (2) using neural networks to discover and enlighten novel results or paradigms in the mathematical sciences. 
</p>
<!--p>The dual-process model of the neural mind distinguishes two kinds of thinking: System I & System II thinking. Existing neural networks mirror System I-styled thinking and assume the stable-world assumption.  
  It is an open question: what mathematical theorems can develop novel neural networks that realise rigorous logical reasoning (System II thinking)? 
</p-->
<p>
  Neural Networks can guide theorists to invent novel theories on mathematical discovery through conjecture generation (Neural-network-assisted mathematics). In the context of heterotic (hybrid) string theory, recent computations of Yukawa couplings, supported by neural network techniques, have put string theory firmly in the era of precision string theory phenomenology. Neural-network-assisted mathematics relies on the remarkable ability of neural networks to act as universal function approximators and enlightenors and speed up mathematical discovery.  
</p>
<p>
  Besides mathematical and scientific discovery, the success of neural networks is witnessed in various domains, e.g., human-like question-answering, playing games, solving IMO tasks. However, accompanied by these exciting successes are LLMs' unpredictable behaviours, errors in simple abstract reasoning.  It remains unclear whether they can achieve the rigour of symbolic reasoning. This brings unpredictable risks to our society. This demands that neural networks carry out rigorous logical reasoning. 
  With Sphere Neural Network, the first neural network achieves the rigour of syllogistic reasoning without training data, this workshop will intrigue theorists and practitioners to reconsider various problems and discuss walk-round solutions.
